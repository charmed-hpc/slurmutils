## Using the issue tracker

The issue tracker is the preferred way for tracking [bug reports](#bug-reports), [feature requests](#feature-requests),
and [submitted pull requests](#pull-requests), but please follow these guidelines for the issue tracker:

* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal issues and/or support requests.
The [Discussions](#discussions) page is a better place to get help for personal support requests.

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on track and have respect for the other
users/contributors of slurmutils.

* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1", ":thumbsup:", or something similar.
Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://blog.github.com/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/)
instead.
  * The maintainers of slurmutils reserve the right to delete comments that violate this rule.

* Please **do not** repost or reopen issues that have been closed. Please either
submit a new issue or browser through previous issues.
  * The maintainers of slurmutils reserve the right to delete issues that violate this rule.

## Issues and Labels

The slurmutils issue tracker uses a variety of labels to help organize and identify issues.
Here is a list of some of these labels, and how the maintainers of slurmutils use them:

* `Type: Bug` - Issues reported in the slurmutils source code that either produce errors or unexpected behavior.

* `Status: Confirmed` - Issues marked `Type: Bug` that have be confirmed to be reproducible on a separate system.

* `Type: Documentation` - Issues for improving or updating slurmutils's documentation.
Can also be used for pull requests.

* `Type: Refactor` - Issues that pertain to improving the existing slurmutils code base.

* `Type: Idea Bank` - Issues that pertain to proposing potential improvement to slurmutils.

* `Type: Enchancement` - Issues marked as an agreed upon enhancement to slurmutils. Can also be used for pull requests.

* `Status: Help wanted` - Issues where we need help from the greater slurmutils community to solve.

For a complete look at slurmutils's labels, see the
[project labels page](https://github.com/canonical/slurmutils/labels).

## Bug Reports

A bug is a *demonstrable problem* that is caused by slurmutils. Good bug reports make slurmutils more robust, so thank
you for taking the time to report issues in the source code!

Guidelines for reporting bugs in slurmutils:

1. __Validate your testlet__ &mdash; ensure that your issue is not being caused by either a semantic or syntactic
error in your testlet's code.

2. __Use the GitHub issue search__ &mdash; check if the issue you are encountering has already been reported by
someone else.

3. __Check if the issue has already been fixed__ &mdash; try to reproduce your issue using the latest `main`
in the slurmutils repository.

4. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; the more pinpointed the issue is, the easier time the slurmutils developers
will have fixing it.

A good bug report should not leave others needing to chase you for more information.
Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce the issue?
What operating system are you experiencing the problem on? Have you had the same results on a different
operating system? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will help the developers fix any
potential bugs.

## Feature Requests

All feature requests should be posted to GitHub Discussions and tagged as `Type: Idea Bank`. The maintainers of
slurmutils already know the features they want to incorporate into slurmutils, but they are always open to
new ideas and potential improvements. GitHub Discussions is the best place to post these types of requests
because it allows for feedback from the entire community and does not bloat the issue tracker. Please note that not
all feature requests will be incorporated into slurmutils. Also, feature requests posted on the issue tracker
will be tagged as `Type: Invalid` and closed. Lastly, please note that spamming the maintainers to incorporate a
feature you want into slurmutils will not improve its likelihood of being implemented; it may result in you receiving
a temporary ban from the repository.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests &mdash; patches, improvements, new features &mdash; are a huge help. These pull requests should
remain focused in scope and should not contain unrelated commits.

__Ask first__ before embarking on any __significant__ pull request (e.g. implementing new features, refactoring code,
incorporating a new test environment provider, etc.), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something
that slurmutils's developers might not want to merge into the project! For trivial things, or things that do not require
a lot of your time, you can go ahead and make a pull request.

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work
included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/slurmutils.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd slurmutils
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/canonical/slurmutils.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, pull the latest changes from the upstream slurmutils repository:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Ensure that your changes pass all tests:

    ```bash
    tox run -e fmt
    tox run -e lint
    tox run -e unit
    ```

5. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

6. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream main
   ```

7. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description against the `main` branch.

this rule.
